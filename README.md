# Spandex Discord Bot

Spandex is a open-source discord bot built by me: Shifty! Its name has a deep meaning to it: Span as in to the full extent and dex as in the index! If you still don't understand what that defined, whelp it means that its an index of my work to the full extend to help communities and developers to try their best to spread hapiness as well!

## How does it work

This is programmed in **Discord.Js** which is a node package that interacts with the discord API fairly easily. The bot is divided in different sectors, each with unique features they are built for. The core is required for all sectors but if you are a developer, the function can be removed easily.

### Sectors

1. **Core**

    - Gathers Statistic for the purpose of the developer, Also takes error codes and sends the code in the console log for you!

2. **Music**

    - Plays Music in your Discord Voice Channel
